# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
This is a PID controller project for Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Porgram.
The project was first cloned from Udacity site.  And then PID controller code was added by editing in PID.cpp and main.cpp

build/screen.txt: this text was created by running a command ./pid > screen.txt.  This contains Kp, Ki, Kd (PID controller
variables) values.

## Compilation

Code was complined using cmake and make.

## Implementation

Used the base algorithm which was discussed in the class.

## Reflection

### The effect of each P, I, D components.

"P" value is the proportional component which is a gain.  It observes the vehicle's distance from the center of the lane 
(cross track error = cte) and if the vehicle is right of the center, it steers to the left.  
And if the vehicle is left, it steers to the right.  The steering angle is determined by cte and this
value which is proportional to cte.  Smaller P value will steer slower rate.

"D" valeu is the differential component. This value prevents an overshoot.  This value multiplies the difference of
cte at each time step, and that means it tries to correct the rate of the change.  

"I" value is the intergration component.  This value adjusts if there is a bias in the CTE.  I don't believe 
there is much bias with this project as the final value was very small.

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Used "twiddle" method which was discussed in the video lecture. 
Kp, Ki, Kd values (PID components) are written in screen.txt. 
It looks like the values are:

Kp = -0.113724 
Ki = -0.00372379 
Kd = -0.113724

Unfotunately, I was able to make this work only with a very low speed.

  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
